  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>Hi, I'm Daphne, a versatile web developer with a passion for 
    creating dynamic, engaging websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
    I’m currently expanding my skills as I work toward becoming a 
    full-stack developer. I have a strong interest in front-end 
    development, where I enjoy bringing creative ideas to life 
    through clean, responsive design.
    </p>
    <p>
    In addition to web development, I have a rich background 
    in music and performing arts. I’ve studied music formally 
    in both Los Angeles and Seoul, South Korea, where I developed 
    my vocal, piano, and violin skills. My unique connection to 
    Korean culture, coupled with my dedication to web development, 
    has allowed me to explore diverse creative projects that blend my passions.
    </p><p>
    When I'm not coding, I love immersing myself in Korean 
    pop culture and sharing my love for music and language 
    through performances and social media. I am always seeking
     new ways to combine my technical and creative abilities. 
     Feel free to reach out—I’m excited to collaborate on
      innovative projects and continue growing in the tech industry.</p>
